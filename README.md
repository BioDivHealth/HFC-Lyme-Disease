# SPHERE-PPL Health Forecasting Contest - UK Lyme Disease

> **This repo/contest is currently under construction so details may change before the start date.**

## Introduction[^readme-1]

[^readme-1]: Adapted from UKHSA Website (<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lyme-borreliosis-epidemiology/lyme-borreliosis-epidemiology-and-surveillance>)

Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne human infection in England and Wales. As elsewhere in northern Europe, the spirochaetes (Borrelia burgdorferi) are transmitted by the hard bodied tick, Ixodes ricinus, commonly known as deer or sheep ticks.

Habitats suitable for acquiring infection occur in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, usually in forested woodland or heathland areas which support the life-cycles of ticks and the small mammals and birds that can be reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi.

Several pathogenic genospecies of B. burgdorferi have been identified in Europe and there is evidence for some variation in the types of clinical presentation caused by these different genospecies.

## Forecasting Outputs
For this contest, we are looking to forecast Lyme Disease Cases at a range of geographical scales for 2024 & 2025.

Forecasts and reports should be saved into the submission folder, matching the template found within. 

## Joining the contest & Getting Started
In order to join the contest, you will need to fork or download the repo.

Here are some covariates that might be an interesting starting point:
- Tick distributions in the UK & other VBD related data: https://github.com/fwimp/ohvbd
- Geographical data for the UK: https://github.com/rspatial/geodata
- National Park GIS data: https://naturalengland-defra.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/national-parks-england/explore?location=53.302276%2C-1.251342%2C7.67


## Rules
-   Any coding languages are allowed but all analyses must be reproducible by the panel.
-   All entries must be loaded into a public Github repo.
-   All entries must follow the submission formats outlined below.
-   All entries must include a max 1000 word report to accompany the forecast analyses. This can be as a separate PDF/hmtl or incorporated into a quarto/jupyter notebook.


## How to Submit
If you forked the repo, congratulations, you have already enetered the contest. We will run the [Forecast AggregatoR](https://github.com/SPHERE-PPL/Forecast-AggregatoR) the day following the close of the contest and your repo will be collated with the entries.

If you did not fork the repo, please send an email to contest@sphere-ppl.org with a link to your public github repo where your forecast and report are stored. These will then be collated with the other entries.
