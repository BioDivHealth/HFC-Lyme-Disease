# SPHERE-PPL Forecasting Contest Template

This is the official template repository for SPHERE-PPL Forecasting Contest. 

Each contest will have its own repository with pre-prepared data (found in the data folder) and a template report (demo_analysis.qmd) that will showcase how to load the data, perform analyses and then export results into the correct format. There will also be a folder for any additional scripts that are required. Any coding languages are allowed but all analyses must be reproducible by the panel. 

More details about the contests and the SPHERE-PPL Community can be found at: <https://SPHERE-PPL.github.io>.

The remainder of this README will show the different sections that will usually be included in the contest set-up.

## Introduction[^readme-1]

[^readme-1]: Adapted from UKHSA Website (<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lyme-borreliosis-epidemiology/lyme-borreliosis-epidemiology-and-surveillance>)
Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne human infection in England and Wales. As elsewhere in northern Europe, the spirochaetes (Borrelia burgdorferi) are transmitted by the hard bodied tick, Ixodes ricinus, commonly known as deer or sheep ticks.

Habitats suitable for acquiring infection occur in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, usually in forested woodland or heathland areas which support the life-cycles of ticks and the small mammals and birds that can be reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi.

Several pathogenic genospecies of B. burgdorferi have been identified in Europe and there is evidence for some variation in the types of clinical presentation caused by these different genospecies.

## Forecasting Outputs
For this contest, we are looking to forecast monthly Lyme Disease Cases at a range of geographical scales for the first ? months of 2025 (?).

Forecasts and reports should be saved into the submission folder, matching the template found within. 

## Joining the contest & Getting Started
Here we will need details of how to fork the repo / download the data and then a brief intro to the .qmd reporting.

## Rules
-   Any coding languages are allowed but all analyses must be reproducible by the panel.
-   All entries must be loaded into a public Github repo.
-   All entries must follow the submission formats outlined below.
-   All entries must include a max 1000 word report to accompany the forecast analyses. This can be as a separate PDF/hmtl or incorporated into a quarto/jupyter notebook.
